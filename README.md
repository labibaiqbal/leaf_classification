Indoor plants often suffer from premature death due to improper care, with nearly 50% of houseplant owners reporting multiple plant losses. To address this, we developed a cost-effective and automated approach that leverages deep learning for real-time plant species identification. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi camera to capture leaf images, which are then preprocessed (resizing, greyscale conversion, thresholding, and edge detection) and fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the TensorFlow Plant Leaves dataset
. The model classifies plants such as basil and lemon with a disclosed level of confidence, enabling SmartGrow to dynamically adjust environmental conditions (light, water, and humidity) based on species-specific requirements. The CNN has been extensively trained on augmented datasets using rotation, scaling, contrast adjustment, flipping, and Gaussian noise, improving generalization and reducing bias. With an achieved accuracy of ~85% and a validation loss of 0.25, this system provides a practical, scalable solution for autonomous plant care.
