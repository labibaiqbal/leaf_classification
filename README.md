Indoor plants often suffer from premature death due to improper care, with nearly 50% of houseplant owners reporting multiple plant losses. To address this, we developed a cost-effective and automated approach that leverages deep learning for real-time plant species identification. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi camera to capture leaf images, which are then preprocessed (resizing, greyscale conversion, thresholding, and edge detection) and fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the TensorFlow Plant Leaves dataset
. The model classifies plants such as basil and lemon with a disclosed level of confidence, enabling SmartGrow to dynamically adjust environmental conditions (light, water, and humidity) based on species-specific requirements. The CNN has been extensively trained on augmented datasets using rotation, scaling, contrast adjustment, flipping, and Gaussian noise, improving generalization and reducing bias. 

The graph below represents the accuracy and loss of the CNN model when training it with 50 epochs. When analyzing the loss trend, the curve initially starts at a high value (~ 2.0) and decreases sharply during the first few epochs. This sharp decline indicates that the model is adjusting the weights, detecting the low-level features such as edges and simple patterns of the training leaf image set. When it reaches around 10 epochs and beyond, the curve gradually flattens and decreases at a steady pace which suggests that overfitting is minimized. Overfitting occurs when the model just “memorizes” the training data rather than extracting meaningful patterns that generalizes for any new data. Towards the end of training, the loss stabilizes to 0.25 and thus the model effectively minimizes all classification errors and can predict any unseen leaf images. In terms of the accuracy curve, it steadily improves from 25% and gradually plateaus to approximately 85% at the end of the training. The curve is also smooth and does not have any major spikes or drops which also indicate that the training process is stable and the parameters chosen, specifically learning rate, batch size and optimizer settings were all tuned properly. To further improve the accuracy level beyond 85%, it will be good to change the optimizer from standard Adam to Ranger. The Ranger optimizer combines two main optimization techniques: Rectified Adam and Lookahead. These two techniques combined help the model converge faster because it will stabilize the training of the images from the early epoch stages itself.
